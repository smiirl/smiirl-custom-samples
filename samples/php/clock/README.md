This example shows time in a counter
1. Make executable and expose the `clock_json.php` to your own url "http://xxxx".
2. In https://my.smiirl.com:
    - Go to the Settings of your counter
    - Change its options to `JSON URL`. 
    - Set the url to the one exposed in step 1.
    - Save your settings.

If you want to have (or skip) the separator between hours and minutes, edit the last line.

To show a blank flap instead of the separator, you can hijack calibration as explained (add tutorial here)
