This example shows time in a counter
- make executable and expose the clock_json.php to your own url "http://xxxx".
- Change your counter to "json" mode and set the url to yours.

- If you want to have (or skip) the separator between hours and minutes, edit the last line.
- To show a blank flap instead of the separator, you can hijack calibration as explained (add tutorial here)
