A Smiirl Custom Counter connected to Twitch is a must-have tool for any Twitch streamer! 

The code presented here allows you to display the **number of followers** of any Twitch account.

## Get started
```
  composer install
  ```
- Create your Twitch app and get its `Client ID` and `Client Secret`: https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/.
- Get the `Account Id` that you want to display. You can easily get it with a tool like: https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-to-user-id/
- Complete your `twitch.php` with previous values, and expose it under your own url "http://twitchcounter.mybusiness.com/twitch.php". 
- In https://my.smiirl.com:
    - Go to the Settings of your counter
    - Change its options to `JSON URL`. 
    - Set the url to the one above. 
    - Choose the attribute you want to show ("number"): 
    - Save your settings.
- Sit back and watch ðŸ¤©
