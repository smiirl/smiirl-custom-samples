# Smiirl is on Zapier! 
## Connect your Counter to hundreds of apps without writing code.

Here's how it works: 
- First, request access to our app by using this link: [https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/19350/9d73c3016a8d02b6ab7a3e683fef327d/](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/19350/9d73c3016a8d02b6ab7a3e683fef327d/)
- You will then be able to see this in your Zapier account ⬇️

- Create a zap to trigger the Smiirl app from a wanted event (email arrived, new paid order, tons of possibilities 😃 )
- Change your Counter to push number mode and get its access informations (id & token) 
- Input the informations into the Smiirl zapp configuration
- Have fun!
