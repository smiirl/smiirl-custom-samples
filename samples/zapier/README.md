# Smiirl is on Zapier! 
## Connect your Counter to hundreds of apps without writing code.

Here's how it works: 
- First, request access to our private zapp : https://zapier.com/app/connections/private/App19350CLIAPI@1.0.0/zaps
- Create a zap to trigger the Smiirl app from a wanted event (email arrived, new paid order...)
- Change your counter to push number node and gets its access informations (id / token) 
- Put these informations into the Smiirl zapp configuration
